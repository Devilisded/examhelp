A civic project is a great way for high school students to get involved in their communities and solve real problems. Students lead these projects and let them pick issues they care about, like helping the environment, fairness, or supporting people who need it. By doing research, making plans, and fixing problems, students get valuable experience and really help.

Civic projects are more than just helping out or doing service. They help students become active citizens who can make changes. Students learn important skills like leading, thinking critically, solving problems, and working with others. They also learn how to deal with complicated things, work with different people, and talk well to support their causes.

Civic projects also help students understand how [democracy](https://www.coe.int/en/web/compass/democracy "democracy{rel='nofollow'}") works and why it's important to be part of it.
