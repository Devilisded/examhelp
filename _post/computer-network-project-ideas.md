The field of computer networking has changed how we talk, share info, and do business in today's digital time. As tech keeps getting better, the need for skilled people who are good at designing, making, and running computer networks has shot up.

Doing computer network projects is a great way to learn. It helps students and new pros learn practical skills and also allows them to think critically, solve problems, and understand network stuff like architectures and rules.

These projects help start a career in computer networking, which is always changing and growing. From making secure and fast local networks (LANs) to understanding big networks (WANs) and cloud computing, computer network projects cover a lot.

In this guide, we've listed 55 computer network project ideas for all skill levels and interests. This helps you try new things, solve real problems, and build a successful career in this growing industry.

## What Are The Types of Computer Network Projects

Computer network projects can be divided into two main types: wired network projects and wireless network projects. Each type has its own challenges, technologies, and real-life uses, making it important for students and pros to try them out.

**Wired Network Projects:**

These projects focus on designing, setting up, and improving networks that use physical cables. They cover things like Ethernet setups, network security, routing rules, and tools for managing networks. By trying these projects, people can learn a lot about structured cable systems, setting up switches, and fixing issues in wired networks.

**Wireless Network Projects:**

On the other hand, wireless network projects examine wireless connections, using radio waves to link up devices. They include different wireless tech like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile networks. People can learn about how signals spread, how to [design antennas](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-antenna-design.html "design antennas {rel='nofollow'}"), and how to keep wireless networks secure. They also get to set up and improve wireless networks for different needs.
