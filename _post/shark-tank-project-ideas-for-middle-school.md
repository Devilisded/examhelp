      question:
        "What kinds of product or service ideas work well for a middle school project like Shark Tank?
        ",
      answer:
        "Middle school students can think of ideas that solve daily problems they face or ideas about things they like. For example, they might think of ways to better organize school supplies, cool phone cases, fun lunch boxes, or new games. Look for creative ideas that don't cost too much to make (if they're physical) and have an obvious group of people who would use them (like their classmates!).

    {
      question: "Do the products need to be real things you can buy, or can they be made up?",
      answer: "Both real, existing products and made-up, invented ones are okay! For real products, students can design and build examples or focus on creative marketing and branding. Invented products allow students to use their imagination and solve problems in totally new ways.",
    },

    {
      question: "How important is the business plan part?",
      answer: "The business plan is a key piece! It doesn't need to be super complicated, but should include details like the product or service, who would use it, pricing, production costs (if applicable), and marketing ideas. This helps students understand the business side of their ideas.",
    },

    {
      question: "What are some ways to give an excellent presentation?",
      answer: "Practice is super important! Students should rehearse their pitch, focusing on being clear, excited, and getting to the point. Visual aids like examples, drawings, or short shows can really help. Encourage them to think about questions people might ask and have answers ready.",
