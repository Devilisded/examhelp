At school, time can feel like it moves strangely. It can feel very slow during boring talks or go slowly when waiting for the last bell to ring. However, there are many things you can do to help time go by faster during the school day. 

Whether you are a student wanting class to end or a teacher wanting to make lessons more exciting, this guide is here to help. We have gathered 15 effective ways to make those school hours feel shorter and more fun. 

These methods include simple changes in thinking and interactive learning activities to keep you interested and entertained. Using these strategies, you can change how you experience time in the classroom and make your school days more lively and energetic. 

So, if you are tired of watching the clock move slowly, read on for our full guide on making time go faster at school, and learn how to use those precious moments for more enjoyable activities!

## Why Does Time Feel Slow in School?
For many students and teachers, time often feels like it moves slowly at school. Even though class periods are the same length as any other day, those hours spent in classrooms can feel extremely long. But why does our sense of time differ in school settings? Understanding the reasons is key to fixing this issue and making class time faster.

### 1. Boredom 
When lessons are not interesting or paying attention is hard, your mind can wander and focus too much on how slowly time is moving. Boring material provides little to keep your brain engaged, so you become aware of the clock slowly ticking. Your brain wants new and engaging things.

### 2. Routine 
The fixed schedule of classes, periods, breaks, etc., becomes repetitive over time. The lack of variety makes each day blend. When every class and transition feels the same, the individual moments lose their uniqueness, causing time to feel like it's dragging.

### 3. Anticipation 
Looking forward to events like the end of school, the weekend, a fun activity, or just the next class can make you intensely aware of every minute that has to pass before reaching that point. The more excited you are for something, the more slowly time crawls before it happens.

### 4. Environment 
Classrooms are often designed for function over appealing visuals or sensory interests. Plain walls, dim lighting, and restrictive desks provide little for your eyes, ears or body to focus on. Unstimulating spaces allow your focus to shift to how slowly time is moving.

### 5. Age 
Young people simply have fewer life experiences to use when judging how slowly or quickly time passes. Since childhood seems to last forever in the moment, each hour, day and week can feel endless compared to when you're older with more memories to measure time against.

The main reason is that factors in the environment and mindset that reduce engagement, stimulation and perceived importance all distort our sense of time, causing it to feel like it's barely moving in the classroom. Understanding these causes can help find solutions.

## Top 15 Ways For How To Make Time Go Faster At School

Here is the list of top 15 way for how to make time go faster at school. 

### 1. Stay Engaged In Class Discussions And Activities

Joining in class talks and activities keeps your mind busy and focused, making time go by faster. Time tends to fly by when fully involved because you're really into what you're doing.

### 2. Break Up The Day Into Smaller Parts 

Instead of seeing the whole school day as one long time, think about it in smaller bits. Focus on finishing one class at a time or set goals for each part. This can make the day feel less big and help time go by faster.

### 3. Join Extracurricular Activities

Getting involved in after-school activities gives you something to look forward to and breaks up the boring parts of the school day. Whether it's sports, clubs, or other fun stuff, these things can make your school time more fun and help time go by quickly.

### 4. Set Small Goals

Setting achievable goals throughout the day gives you something to aim for and feel good about. It could be finishing a homework assignment, understanding a tricky lesson, or making it through a tough class. Hitting these small targets can make the day more satisfying and help time pass faster.

### 5. Listen To Music Or Podcasts

Listening to music or interesting podcasts during free time can make tasks less boring and fun. Music can make you feel good and keep you motivated, while podcasts can give you cool stuff to think about, making time seem to go by faster.

### 6. Take Short Breaks

Taking breaks between classes or during study time can help refresh your mind and stop you from feeling tired. Use these breaks to stretch, take a short walk, or chat with friends. These little breaks can help you feel more alive and make the day more lively.

### 7. Hang Out With Friends.

Sitting with friends you like who make you laugh can make the school day more enjoyable. Talking, laughing, and being around people you like can help time pass quicker and make the day less boring.

### 8. Challenge Yourself

Taking on tough schoolwork or projects can make the day more interesting and rewarding. When dealing with tricky stuff, time can fly by as you get into learning and solving problems.

### 9. Make Learning Fun

Finding ways to make learning fun can make school feel less like work. Playing games, doing group activities, or trying hands-on experiments can make learning more exciting. When learning is fun, time seems to go by faster because you're having a good time and learning simultaneously.

### 10. Stay Organized

You can avoid wasting time and feeling bored by staying organized and managing your time well. Use planners, lists, or phone apps to track what you must do. When you know what you must do, the day can feel more purposeful and go by quicker.

### 11. Use Technology Wisely

Technology can help you learn and stay interested in class. Use educational apps, online resources, or interactive learning stuff to help you understand subjects better. Ensure you use tech well and don't get distracted so time doesn't drag on.

### 12. Ask Questions

Talking with your teachers and asking questions can help keep your mind active and make the school day fun. When you're curious and into learning, time seems to go by faster because you're really into what you're learning.

### 13. Imagine Your Goals

Take a moment to think about what you want to achieve in the future. Whether getting into a good college, having a cool job, or being successful, having a clear idea of what you want can help keep you motivated and focused during the school day. When you're motivated and focused, time seems to go by faster because you're working toward something important.

### 14. Look Forward To The Fun Stuff.

Thinking about fun things that are coming up can make the school day more exciting. Whether it's a school event, sports game, or just plans with friends, having something to look forward to can help make the day feel better and make time go by faster.
