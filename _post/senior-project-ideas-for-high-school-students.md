You can talk about your project in your statement and list it as an activity outside of school, including any awards, writing, or things you made. Colleges value students who can work towards long-term goals.

If you plan on going to college later, your project will give you good stuff for your resume when applying for jobs or [internships](https://careers.umbc.edu/employers/internships/what-is-an-internship/ "internships{rel='nofollow'}").
