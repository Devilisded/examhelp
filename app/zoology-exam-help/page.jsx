                            When getting ready for a zoology exam, students often face some everyday struggles. Here's what they are:

                                Zoology uses many science words that can be difficult to learn or remember. This can make studying and answering test questions a bit tricky.

                                Zoology covers many areas, such as animal body parts, behaviors, and how they've changed over time. Thus, keeping up with all these topics can feel overwhelming.

                                Zoology isn't just about learning facts; it's also about how different animals relate to each other and their surroundings. Thus, grasping these connections can be difficult.

                            <li className="pb-2 font-bold">Much to Remember</li>

                            <p className="pb-2">
                                There's a lot of information to commit to memory, like animal names, groupings, and specific traits. It can feel like too much to learn.

                            </p>

                        </ul>

                            These struggles can make preparing for a zoology exam feel really daunting. However, with the right approach, such as using visuals and studying with classmates, students can improve their understanding and do well on their exams.
