                Get your setup squared away early. Make sure your computer,
                internet, and any required software are working smoothly. It is
                wise to do a practice run if you can.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-2">
                Find a quiet spot to take the exam without any distractions or
                interruptions. Tell your roommates or family not to annoy you.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-2">
                Keep an eye on the clock. Online exams usually have a time
                limit, so pace yourself. Don't consume too much time on just one
                query.
              </li>
              <li className="pb-2">
                Read those instructions carefully. The details matter, so pay

                Take short breaks if you need to refresh. Stretch your legs, and

              </li>
              <li className="pb-2">
                Have some scratch paper handy to jot notes, draw diagrams, or
                work out coding problems. A pen and paper can help organize your
                thoughts.
              </li>

                Stay calm, cool, and collected. If you run into tech issues or
