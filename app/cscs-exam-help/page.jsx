            <ul className="pb-2 list-decimal"><li className="pb-2 font-bold">Know the Exam Inside Out </li>

<p className="pb-2">Get familiar with how the CSCS test is structured. Learn the number of questions, time limit, and topics covered. This intel will help you make a smart study plan.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Use the Official Outline</li>

<p className="pb-2">Snag the CSCS exam blueprint straight from the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) website. Pore over it to see exactly what material you need to master.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Mix Up Your Study Materials </li>

<p className="pb-2">Don't just use one textbook or course. Use various study resources, such as practice tests, online material, study guides and more, to reinforce the concepts.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Schedule Study Sessions</li>

<p className="pb-2">Create a structured study schedule with set times to review all the exam topics. Break it into bite-sized chunks and set goals for each session.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Double Down on Weak Spots</li>

<p className="pb-2">Take practice quizzes to identify your strengths and weaknesses. Then, spend extra time strengthening those weaker areas while maintaining your strengths.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Practice Against the Clock</li>

<p className="pb-2">Get used to answering questions within the real exam's time constraints. Time yourself on practice tests to build endurance.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Make It a Consistent Habit</li>

<p className="pb-2">Consistency is everything. Carve out dedicated study periods daily or weekly and stick to the schedule. No cramming is allowed—that's a recipe for burnout.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Don't Go It Alone</li>

<p className="pb-2">Bounce ideas off peers, mentors, or pro organizations. Join study groups or online forums to swap tips and resources.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Take Care of Yourself</li>

<p className="pb-2">Make self-care a priority. Get solid sleep, eat right, exercise, and de-stress with meditation or deep breathing techniques.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Have Unshakeable Confidence</li>

<p className="pb-2">Believe you've got this! Stay positive and be confident in all your hard work prepping. Visualize that passing score and trust your dedication will pay off.</p></ul>

<p className="pb-2">Ready to succeed on the CSCS exam? With these helpful tips, you can tackle the test and start your journey as a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist.</p>
