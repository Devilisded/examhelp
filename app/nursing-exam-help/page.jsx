                <p className="pb-2">
                  Often, reading alone does not suffice. You can create study
                  aids, participate in group discussions, and try out tests
                  using practice exams; this helps solidify your understanding

                <p className="pb-2">
                  Proper timing is essential when taking nursing exams. These
                  tutors will guide you on how to pace yourself, decide which
                  questions to answer first and manage stress during examination
                  periods.

                <li className="font-bold pb-2">Critical Thinking </li>
                <p className="pb-2">
                  Nursing examinations typically require higher-order thinking
                  abilities. Our instructors will expose you to real-life
                  situations, analytical puzzles, and practices that improve
                  your critical thinking capabilities.
                </p>
                <li className="font-bold pb-2">Focus on Content Review </li>
                <p className="pb-2">
                  Determine your strengths and areas for further improvement in
                  different areas of nursing. Do focused revision exercises with
                  our teachers to address knowledge gaps and reinforce difficult
                  concepts on handout materials.
                </p>

                <li className="font-bold pb-2">Practice Is The Key </li>
                <p className="pb-2">
                  Regular practice involving realistic exam questions boosts
                  confidence and improves test-taking skills. Our tutors will
                  provide many practice materials and detailed feedback to
