            There are several different approaches to medicine and healing the body. While they may differ in their philosophies and methods, they all aim to improve health and well-being. This overview covers five major streams related to medicines.

            </p>
            <ul className="list-decimal"><li className="pb-2 font-bold">Mainstream Medicine</li>

<p className="pb-2">Regular medicine is the most common type of medical care. It uses man-made drugs and treatments to cure diseases and ease symptoms. It is widely practiced in Western countries. Regular medicine relies on scientific studies and proven practices to develop treatments.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Ayurvedic Medicine</li>

<p className="pb-2">Ayurveda is an ancient natural healing system from India over 5,000 years old. It uses natural herbs, diets, and lifestyle changes to promote health and balance in the body. Ayurvedic medicine aims to restore balance within the body, mind, and spirit through personalized plans.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Homeopathic Medicine</li>

<p className="pb-2">Homeopathy is a system started in the late 1700s by a German doctor named Samuel Hahnemann.</p>

<p className="pb-2">It is based on the idea that very diluted substances can trigger the body's natural healing. Homeopathic remedies are made by drastically diluting substances in water, with the belief higher dilution increases the healing effect.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) </li>

<p className="pb-2">Traditional Chinese Medicine has a 2,500-year-old history. It uses herbs, acupuncture, diets, and practices to restore the balance of vital energy (qi) in the body. TCM addresses root causes of disease to restore harmony within the body's systems, not just symptoms.</p>

<li className="pb-2 font-bold">Naturopathic Medicine</li>

<p className="pb-4">Naturopathic medicine focuses on prevention and the body's ability to heal itself. It uses natural remedies like herbs, diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to support natural healing. Naturopathic doctors identify and treat the underlying causes of illness for the whole person.</p></ul>

<p className="pb-2">While these different streams take varied approaches, they all strive to promote healing and enhanced well-being through their respective philosophies and methodologies. The right approach depends on an individual's needs and beliefs.</p>
