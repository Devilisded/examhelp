                            The sciences use tons of specific vocabulary with precise meanings that can get confusing and hard to keep straight. Mixing up words that sound alike can lead to incorrect answers on tests.

                            Much of science involves things we can't see with our eyes at the tiny molecular and atomic levels or in space. Imagining these unseen processes, interactions, and structures from diagrams or descriptions is challenging.

                            Science exams frequently require total recall of in-depth factual details, lengthy step-by-step procedures, complicated diagrams, and the ability to combine multiple ideas for problem-solving.

                            The combination of reading through wordy scenarios, interpreting charts and data tables, showing all work for complex calculations, and writing thorough explanations makes managing your time extremely difficult.
