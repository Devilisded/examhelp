                Science tests can be tough for students in a lot of different
                ways. From understanding complex ideas to solving math problems,
                many potential areas cause difficulties. Some common struggles
                students face include:
              </p>

                </li>
                <p className="pb-2">
                  The sciences use tons of specific vocabulary with precise
                  meanings that can get confusing and hard to keep straight.
                  Mixing up words that sound alike can lead to incorrect answers
                  on tests.
                </p>

                <p className="pb-2">
                  Much of science involves things we can't see with our eyes at
                  the tiny molecular and atomic levels or in space. Imagining
                  these unseen processes, interactions, and structures from
                  diagrams or descriptions is challenging.

                  Science exams frequently require total recall of in-depth
                  factual details, lengthy step-by-step procedures, complicated
                  diagrams, and the ability to combine multiple ideas for
                  problem-solving.

                <p className="pb-2">
                  The combination of reading through wordy scenarios,
                  interpreting charts and data tables, showing all work for
                  complex calculations, and writing thorough explanations makes
                  managing your time extremely difficult.

                <p className="pb-2">
                  The high-pressure nature of many science exams can cause
                  significant anxiety in students, making it harder to
                  concentrate, remember things, and do your best work.
